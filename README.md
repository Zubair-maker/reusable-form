# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Create a Reusable Form Component:
To avoid duplicating code for your signup and signin forms and avoid to the DRY principle, we can create a reusable form component that accepts props to handle different inputs and behaviors for each form. 

note: Here Im using input form element.

Reusability: The Form component is reusable and customizable for different forms by just passing title, fields, and onSubmit as props.
Avoid DRY: This approach avoids code duplication for signup and signin by using the same form logic.
